# Movie-revenue-prediction
Trained model that uses 10 different algorithms to predict the revenue of a movie before it's release and compare their results. 
The data is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/data).

The algorithms used for the prediction:
  1. Artificial Neural Network
  2. Light Gradient Boosting Machine	
  3. Random Forest	
  4. XGBoost	
  5. CatBoost Regressor	
  6. Elastic-Net	
  7. Ridge Regression	
  8. Linear Regression	
  9. Polynomial Regression	
  10. Support Vector Regression
